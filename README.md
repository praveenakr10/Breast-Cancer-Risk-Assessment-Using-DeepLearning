## Breast-Cancer-Risk-Assessment-Ensemble
Soft voting ensemble of CNN architectures for accurate and reliable breast cancer detection from histopathological images.

Overview

This project implements an ensemble learning approach for early breast cancer detection using medical imaging data. Multiple deep learning models are combined using soft voting to improve classification accuracy, robustness, and reliability compared to individual models.

Highlights

- Ensemble of deep learning models for medical image classification

- Soft voting strategy to enhance diagnostic performance

- Focus on early detection and risk assessment

- Designed for research and academic experimentation

Method

- Image preprocessing and feature learning using CNN-based models

- Individual model training and evaluation

- Ensemble aggregation through probability-based soft voting

Purpose

This repository is intended for academic, research, and learning purposes, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble techniques in medical image–based disease detection.
